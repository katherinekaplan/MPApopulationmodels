Description: This package contains seven functions that output different plots and metrics of population responses to marine protected areas.    closedpop_metrics calculates rho (the rate of return to the stable age distribution in an unfished population),  theta (the angle between the stable age distribution in the MPA), and P1 (the period of oscillations), Nratio (the change in abundance in the MPA as compared to the fished state over time), and Bratio (the change in biomass of in the MPA over time as compared to the fished state).
